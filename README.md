####What is it?
Chimera is a fraction-based grid framework that supports 24 column grids for finer control over your layout.
16 column grids are similarly supported, along with any simple factors of 24 or 16: 12, 8, 6, 4, 3, and 2. Chimera is inspired by the Bootstrap, Skeleton, and Foundation frameworks.

Chimera is designed using a Node based environment, and utilizes the Jade template engine as well as the Stylus stylesheet language.
